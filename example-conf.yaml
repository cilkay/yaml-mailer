smtp:
  # Example showing gmail's SMTP settings, but any server can be used.
  server: smtp.gmail.com
  port: 587

  # Change both 'user' and 'from'.
  # With gmail, these are the same, but other SMTP servers may
  # behave differently.
  user: user@domain.com
  from: user@domain.com

  # With gmail, obtain a Google application-specific password from:
  # https://www.google.com/settings/account
  password: password

  tls: True

# The original script assumed that messages and attachments
# were in the same path as yaml-mailer.py. That is not a safe
# assumption to make. Messages and attachments would usually
# be in the same directory but the configuration below
# gives us the flexibility to put them in different directories.

paths:
  messages_path: /path/to/messages/
  attachments_path: /path/to/messages/
